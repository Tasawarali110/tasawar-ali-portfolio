TASAWAR ALI PORTFOLIO - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
========================================

YOU HAVE 2 OPTIONS:

========================================
OPTION 1: DEPLOY WITHOUT NODE.JS (EASIEST!)
========================================

Since npm is not working, you can deploy directly to Vercel without installing Node.js!

STEP 1: Push to GitHub
----------------------
Open PowerShell in this folder and run these commands ONE BY ONE:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Tasawar Ali Portfolio"
git branch -M main

Now create a repository on GitHub:
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name: tasawar-ali-portfolio
3. Make it PUBLIC
4. Click "Create repository"

Then run (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tasawar-ali-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main

STEP 2: Deploy on Vercel
-------------------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your "tasawar-ali-portfolio" repository
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait 2-3 minutes

DONE! You'll get a URL like: https://tasawar-ali-portfolio.vercel.app

========================================
OPTION 2: INSTALL NODE.JS FIRST (FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT)
========================================

If you want to run the portfolio locally on your computer:

STEP 1: Install Node.js
------------------------
1. Go to: https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS version (Long Term Support)
3. Run the installer
4. Restart your computer

STEP 2: Install Dependencies
-----------------------------
Open a NEW PowerShell window in this folder and run:

npm install

Wait 2-5 minutes for installation to complete.

STEP 3: Start Development Server
---------------------------------
npm run dev

Your portfolio will open at: http://localhost:5173

STEP 4: Build for Production
-----------------------------
npm run build

This creates a "dist" folder with your built website.

========================================
RECOMMENDED PATH FOR YOU
========================================

Since npm is not working right now, I recommend:

1. Use OPTION 1 (Deploy to Vercel directly)
2. Your portfolio will be live in 10 minutes
3. Install Node.js later if you want to make changes locally
4. For now, you can edit files and push to GitHub
5. Vercel will automatically rebuild and deploy
